# IMPORTANT: Run this script as an Administrator and review each command carefully before execution.

# User Account Configuration
# Note: Specific user account management (e.g., creating users, setting passwords) is highly specific and needs manual input.

# Disable Unauthorized User Accounts
$authorizedUsers = @('User1', 'User2') # Add authorized usernames here
Get-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.Name -notin $authorizedUsers } | Disable-LocalUser

# Disable Guest Account (modify as needed based on your readme file)
Disable-LocalUser -Name 'Guest'

# Windows Update Configuration
Write-Host "Configuring Windows Update..."
Set-Service -Name wuauserv -StartupType 'Manual'
Start-Service -Name wuauserv
Install-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot

# Account Policies - Password Policy
Write-Host "Setting Password Policy..."
# Export the current security settings
secedit /export /cfg "$env:temp\secpol.cfg"
# Modify the security settings
(gc "$env:temp\secpol.cfg").replace("PasswordComplexity = 0", "PasswordComplexity = 1").replace("MinimumPasswordLength = 0", "MinimumPasswordLength = 8").replace("PasswordHistorySize = 0", "PasswordHistorySize = 3").replace("MaximumPasswordAge = 42", "MaximumPasswordAge = 90").replace("MinimumPasswordAge = 0", "MinimumPasswordAge = 10") | Out-File "$env:temp\secpol.cfg"
# Apply the modified settings
secedit /configure /db "$env:windir\security\new.sdb" /cfg "$env:temp\secpol.cfg" /areas SECURITYPOLICY
# Clean up
